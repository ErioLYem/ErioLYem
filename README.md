## Hi, my name is Danil!
I have two degrees: one is a specialized secondary, the second is an incomplete higher education.

I took additional courses in system administration.

I like to study, to learn something new for myself. I love pets, read books and watch movies.

I studied programming languages: C#, Python, Delphi, C++, Pascal.
